GENERAL LEXICON RULES ...
- idXDoor ... just door ... could say the room the door goes to . . . maybe later. doesn't really matter, ultimately just compounds compounding with compounds that compound
- idLongHallwayFrontOpeningDoor ... front door
- idXYOpening ... front/back/etc opening
- idXKey ... just key ... ugh ok maybe describe the key
- idXKeyhole ... just key hole
- idXLock ... just lock
- idMachineDoorHandle ... just handle

BABY
- idXButton ... describe the button so GoButton can't be included


... okay generally for doors, openings, handles, because they're so common i'm just going to pick something to do,
like describing room door goes to but only saying opening, handle, key, and lock

... BUT for other things that are more rare like "go button" or "on switch" i CAN just force button or switch but if i can't faithfully replicate it i will skip it

... like for the most part i COULD faithfully replicate The Dramma Building Right Opening etc but it's just excessive
not doing that is a different decision from "cheating" compounds i can't achieve

should also take out "adam left hand" because i cheated that too
