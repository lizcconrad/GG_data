AtomicCity Lexicon Notes
- Can't do "Adam" ... didn't include named stuff, easy to add but wasn't considered during development
- skipping all adam's (including hands)
- not lexicalizing "idCurrentLevel" ... seems to always point to a button? Not sure what it means, skipping it
- idFuse30A ... just calling it fuse, might want like "The fuse numbered 30A" but whatever
- rip can't do ordinality or any sort of numbers... "the 2 button"
- ShutOffValveLight ... "valve light" i guess..........
- idOnSwitch ... skip, can't do "on" switch
- idLockMechanism ... "with a" idk
- Can't do "Idaho" either

idMachine1_prop_idPowerControl ... breaks everything because it Looks Like an ERG predicate ... so i just took it out
and edited the graph not to break it but it does count as a failure in the coverage

GRAPH NOTES
idAtomicCityOutside1
    - two openings, two wolves, kind of naturally disambiguates the wolves but not rly
idElevator1
    - "unlighted off lights" ... REAL -_-
idOnSwitch
    - comes out as "the off switch" which feels like it means the switch that turns things off but it's really the switch That Is off rip gg
