SCENARIO
- on??? "the on light" i do not understand why on is so difficult ... i guess it's very awwkard to say "the on light" anyway but i can do the "off" light ....? anyway skipping in lexicon (idBook1_subgraph)
- idBook1Page3Torn, idBook1Page3TornText ... i can't say "the torn page" because i didn't account for passive participles in the nodes themselves... so i'm skipping it even though i could do "the book page" ... i can't be Faithful
- idPlage can't do, idLexi can't do, skipping all Lexis :(
- still can't do ordinality
- idFlashlight2Switch ... just "switch" bc idFlashlight2 is "with a switch" so i don't want "flashlight with a flashlight switch"
